# Finhacks 2018 Submission

I use this to achieve 0.90 and 0.85 for fraud detection and credit default respectively.
The code require

* sklearn library for machine learning.
* pyplot and seaborn plotting library.
* Numpy for matrix manipulation.
* Pandas for dataframe manipulation.
* Scipy for the zscore transformation.

Basic Anaconda installation should be able to run it.
